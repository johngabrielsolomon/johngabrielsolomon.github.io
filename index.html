			<p>I think my skill/talent is drawing. I love drawing but I am not that good enough and I am still trying to improve myself. I am currently trying to draw digitally and it is hard but also fun. You can watch <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-0i7bg0PzQoDMGrr2itXhfUkPqdC9b9g/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a> one of my video.</p>

			<p>My strength in terms of IT field is I like coding and I like to explore more about computers. And my weakness in terms of IT field is I'm always procrastinating and I easily forget things that I need to do and that’s why I want to improve myself. After I graduate I see myself as a Programmer.</p>
